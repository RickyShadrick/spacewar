# spacewar a simple c# game for learning and understanding the processes of arrays, for loops, if statements and simple memory management.
managing memory is the main gaol of developing this game, i saw someone develop it using loops so i changed some of the functions and used some arrays in order to make sure i wasn't wasting resources. I'll keep updating and improving on it.
